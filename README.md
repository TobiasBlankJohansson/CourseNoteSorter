# Course Note Sorter
It's a small program that lets you create courses as blueprints and quickly create a text file of the blueprint to take notes in.
# Why
I created this small project to help a friend who wanted an easier way to make notes and skip the need to create a file manually. It also gave me a fun little project 
in which I could expand my knowledge and experience working with object-oriented programming. I also try to apply the principles from SOLID and deepen my experience working 
with them.
